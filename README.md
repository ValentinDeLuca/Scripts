MP4 to Frames Conversion Script

Overview

This Python script is designed to extract frames from a video file (test2.mp4) and save them as JPEG images. 
The script allows users to choose between three filters:
 - Grayscale
 - Rotatations (random)
 - Resize (based on x y dimensions) 
Once the frames are extracted and processed, they are saved in the working directory and subsequently compressed into a ZIP file for convenient export.

This tool is particularly useful for generating datasets to feed into AI models, enabling the creation of custom datasets with specific properties such as size, orientation, and color format.
